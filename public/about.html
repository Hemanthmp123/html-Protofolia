  <h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>Lois Griffin: Peter, it's just a phase. You've gone through a few yourself, you know. Brian Griffin: Yeah, like those two weeks you spent narrating your own life. Peter Griffin: [flashback] I walked into the kitchen and sat down at the table. I looked with a grimace at the questionable meal Lois had placed in front of me. Of course, I would never tell her how disgusted I was with her cooking, but somehow I think she knew. Lois had always been full of energy and life, but lately I had begun to grow more aware of her aging. The bright, exuberant eyes that I had fallen in love with were now beginning to grow dull and listless with the long fatigue of a weary life. [Lois slugs Peter, knocking him out - cut to nighttime] Peter Griffin: I awoke several hours later in a daze. Brian Griffin: Jake brought vodka to the school dance, and Chris got blamed for it, and it's really turn his life upside-down face. [Stewie stares at Brian in disbelief] Tom Tucker: It's no concern to me if it's turned his life upside-down face, Jake's a good boy! Isn't that right, Jake? Jake Tucker: Yeah! Stewie Griffin: She packed my bags. Last night preflight. Zero hour 9am [inhales cigarette] Stewie Griffin: and I'm gonna be... high... as a kite by then. [transparent Stewie clone #1] Stewie Griffin: And I think its gonna be a long time til touch down brings me round again to find, I'm not the man they think I am at home, Oh No no! I'm a rocket man. Rocket man! Burnin out his fuse out here, Alone! [Transparent stewie clone #2 bow tie undone] Stewie Griffin: And I think its gonna be a long time til touch down brings me down again to find, I'm not the man they think I am at home, Oh no no no! I'm a rock it man. Rocket man! burnin out his fuse out here. Alone! Brian: Peter, your excuses are lamer than FDR's legs. [everyone gasps] Brian: Too soon? Lois Griffin: Hello? Peter Griffin: Lois? I can't take out the garbage because they're keeping me late at the office. Lois Griffin: Peter, the caller ID says you're calling from the kitchen. In fact... I can see you. Peter Griffin: Can you see me now? Lois Griffin: No. Peter Griffin: Okay, now I'm at the office·∏ç.</p>

    Peter Griffin: [opening drawer] Hey, Lois, there's a Bible in here! [He opens the book and dances around with it] Peter Griffin: Hey, look at me! I'm a Christian! I'm reading the Bible! Gay Dog: Hey! You guys got any cheese doodles? [honks horn] Gay Dog: See, that's what I do, I ask for a snack, and then I blow the horn. Glen Quagmire: [Quagmire slowly peaks out at Meg's slumber party] Oh, come on! You girls are boring the crap out of me! You know what I'm going to do? I... I... I'm going to go home and watch a dirty movie now! It's all this mindless chattering is what it is! [he leaves] Meg: Wow, that was weird. Hey, you wanna compare breasts? Peter Griffin: It's OK, Meg. Your mom is full of Christmas cheer and enough tranquilizer to take down an elephant. Tom Tucker: In local news, a Buddy Cianci High School student was caught with a lot of cocaine in his locker. He was sentenced to 100 hours of community service, and is a very bad boy. And now we go to Ollie Williams for the punishment forecast, Ollie. [cuts to Ollie] Ollie Williams: He gonna get it!</p>

    Tom Tucker: I think I speak for everyone when I say, New York and everyone from there can fornicate themselves with an iron stick. Peter Griffin: They let Sarah Jessica Parker's face on TV and she looks like a foot. Meg: I cant believe my stupid parents are going to spend five stupid days following stupid Kiss on tour. That's painful. Peter Griffin: Not as painful as a tire iron upside your head. Meg: What? Peter Griffin: Nothing. [Peter has had plastic surgery] Lois Griffin: Ahh, I hate what you've become. Why don't you go back to that doctor and have him suck the fat out of your head? Peter Griffin: Maybe I will, and then I'll put it on my feet and stand on Paul Bunyan's giant skillet to cook his flapjacks. Lois Griffin: That doesn't make any sense. Peter Griffin: It doesn't have to. I'm beautiful. Peter Griffin: [trying to console Cleveland at audition for a Bachelor show coming up] It's the fabric, It's the fabric. Let's get your clothes off. [takes off Cleveland's shirt and pants] Cleveland: Peter, what is wrong with you? I'm naked. Peter Griffin: Oh, god you're self-conscious [Peter takes off his shirt and pants too] Peter Griffin: See, now you're not alone.</p>
